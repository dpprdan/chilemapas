Description: Maps and datasets of the different administrative divisions of 
  Chile (excluding Antartic territories).
  The data within this package comes as \code{data.frame} and 
  \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame}.
  All the maps contained within this package are released by the chilean
  government under DFL-83 (year 1979), clause that means that these maps are just
  referential. The reason behind the release clause is that these maps are
  simplified topologies for fast map rendering and lightweight files.
  Don't (really, don't) use these maps if you require geodesic precision.
