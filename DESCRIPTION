Description: Maps and datasets of the different administrative territories of 
  Chile (excluding Antartic territories) released as a part of the public
  information created by the Chilean Government.
  The data within this package comes as \code{data.frame} and 
  \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} while the GitHub repository provides tidy
  \code{topojson}/\code{csv} files and raw \code{geojson} files.
  All the maps contained within this package are released by the copyright
  holder under DFL-83 (year 1979) clause that means that these maps are just
  referential and may differ from the official maps published by the
  Geographic Militar Institute of Chile. The reason behind this release clause
  is that these maps are simplified topologies for fast map rendering and 
  lightweight files.
  Don't (really, don't) use these maps if you require geodesic precision.
