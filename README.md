## Installation

Install the **chilemaps** package with this code:

```
if (!require("remotes")) { install.packages("remotes") }
remotes::install_github("pachamaltese/chilemaps")
```

This package shall probably never be on CRAN. Chilemaps features more than 50MB while CRAN limit is 5MB.

## Usage

See https://pacha.hk/chilemaps for examples. I've included a quite complete vignette where I explain how to use chilemaps with ggplot2 and other packages such as rmapshaper.
